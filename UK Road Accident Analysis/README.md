## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create an interactive Excel dashboard for analyzing and visualizing UK road accident data. By utilizing the power of Excel's features and functions, the aim is to provide actionable insights into road safety, identify patterns, and explore the factors contributing to accidents.
By analyzing the available dataset, this report aims to provide valuable information to policymakers, transportation authorities, and other stakeholders to improve road safety measures and reduce accident rates in the United Kingdom.

## Data Explorationa:
* Gather and explore the data, including information such as accident location, date, time, weather conditions, road type, vehicle type, and severity of the accident.
* This dataset containes 3.07 million rows and 21 features.
* The data was obtained from a open source dataset.

## Data Cleaning:
* The dataset was standardized to ensure consistency in variables, such as date and time formats, road types, and accident severity levels.
* Created 3 new columns  Month, Year and Day_of_the_week from the existing column of Accident_Date for better time series analysis.
* Checked and removed duplicate values from different features of the data.
* Used search and replace to handle typo error in the accident_severity column.
* Ensured the integrity of the data.

## Data Analysis:
* The dataset was analyzed to identify and quantify correlation between different features using pivot tables.
* Summary statistics were calculated for variables such as accident frequency, severity, and contributing factors.
* The dataset was analyzed to identify daily, monthly, and yearly accident trends, highlighting any seasonal variations.

## Visualization and Summarization: 
* Developed dynamic charts, graphs, and tables to visualize accident trends, identify high-risk areas, and understand the relationship between different variables.
* Designed an intuitive and user-friendly Excel dashboard with interactive elements, allowing users to explore and filter data based on specific criteria, facilitating easy data exploration and analysis.

## Summary: 
This data analysis project provides valuable insights into UK road accidents, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and implement targeted interventions to improve road safety. By understanding the key contributing factors and implementing appropriate measures, it is possible to reduce accident rates and ensure safer roads for all.
